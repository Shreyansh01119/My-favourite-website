        <p>I like cricket because it is an intresting game.In this game . Two batsmen are on the field at the same time during play, one at each wicket. If the ball is in play and one of the batsmen is out of his ground, he is usually liable to being put out. ... A batsman is run out by having the wicket at his end broken while he is out of his ground.I like this game a lot</p>

It had previously been arranged that a cricket team captained by Ivo Bligh would tour Australia in 1882-83 and this team became the English hope of victory. Before leaving England for Australia, Bligh pledged to bring back "The Ashes of English cricket".[3]

Three main Test matches were played. The first was in Melbourne and was won by Australia. The second was also in Melbourne and won by the English. The third match was in Sydney and was again won by the English. After this it was generally acknowledged that the English were the victors.

After the conclusion of the Test series, a match was played in Sydney in which a United Australian Eleven defeated The Hon. Ivo Bligh's Eleven by four wickets.[4] This seems to have given rise in Melbourne to some debate about whether it should have counted as a Fourth Test.[5] However, The Sydney Morning Herald made it very clear that this game was not part of the international "rubber" which had in fact been won by England.[6] There were also other matches played between the English and the individual State cricket teams over the tour.
